# Expensify App 

## Expensify is designed to help us organise...well... our own expenses!

Here is the updated version of the application - with all commits and additional minor fixes in the syntax of the code itself.
Application uses Redux for the state management. The whole database is operated via Firebase.

You can check my application right here: https://real-expensify.herokuapp.com/

And don't worry, Firebase is responsible for the whole authentication process, so your data will not fall into wrong hands.
